# Version Express Router

This package provides several decorators to make it easy to build up routers for APIs with a multiple version control, parameter validations and pre/post processing injector.


## Development
You can link the library by running the following command on root directory.
```
> npm link
```
Then, move to a project that is supposed to be linked to the library and run the following command.
```
> npm link version-express-router
```
If there is no issues, the library will be shown in the `node_modules` directory on your test project.
